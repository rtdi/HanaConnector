                       COMMERCIAL LICENSE
                          21 June 2020

                            Preamble

  The Commercial License is an addendum to the GPL license - see
LICENSE in the same folder - superseding certain license
related aspects.
It applies to productive environments only, not Test, QA or 
development systems. For those, the GPL license applies providing
a free usage license. 

  The main purpose of the commercial license is to bill for the
usage of the Program on a monthly basis, thus allowing further 
development.
The key metric used is the number of messages processed by the
Program per month.

                           PAY-PER-USE

Programs are billed according to the following table

   <100’000messages/month	  0EUR/month
 <1’000’000messages/month	 50EUR/month
<10’000’000messages/month	100EUR/month
>10’000’000messages/month	200EUR/month

(plus taxes if applicable)

Example 1: In a test environment the Program is evaluated for
its performance over a long period of time.
--> The Program is used under the GPL license as it is executed in a
test environment, not a production system, hence no fees occur.

Example 2: The Program is used to copy productive data, the amount
of rows copied is 50'000rows per month.
--> The program is used under this Commercial License but the
fee is 0EUR according to above table. No contract needs to be signed,
no invoices will be created. 

Once an order is placed for a defined volume, rtdi.io GmbH (Austria,
Europe), as the copyright owner, will send invoices on a monthly basis
until the contract is terminated. The contract can be terminated at 
any time and ends with the last day of the month the termination
information was received (CET and business hours apply).

The Program is configured by default to send usage statistics, but
these numbers are informal only. They can not be used as the
basis for calculating the usage as they are estimates only and
optional. (See documentation on how to disable and the
GDPR - General Data Protection and Privacy - information)  

                 DIFFERENCES TO SOFTWARE LICENSES

Unlike classic software licenses, where license and support contract
go in tandem, the monthly usage is charged and the Program provided
as-is. As consequence no support and no warranties are provided. In 
this regards all clauses of the GPL apply, specifically but not 
exclusive Section 15 and Section 16.
In the spirit of Open Source, the Source code is provided to the
public and thus you.
